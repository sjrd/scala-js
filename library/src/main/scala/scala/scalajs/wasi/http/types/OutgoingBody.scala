/** Represents an outgoing HTTP Request or Response's Body.
 *
 *  A body has both its contents - a stream of bytes - and a (possibly
 *  empty) set of trailers, inducating the full contents of the body
 *  have been sent. This resource represents the contents as an
 *  `output-stream` child resource, and the completion of the body (with
 *  optional trailers) with a static function that consumes the
 *  `outgoing-body` resource, and ensures that the user of this interface
 *  may not write to the body contents after the body has been finished.
 *
 *  If the user code drops this resource, as opposed to calling the static
 *  method `finish`, the implementation should treat the body as incomplete,
 *  and that an error has occurred. The implementation should propagate this
 *  error to the HTTP protocol by whatever means it has available,
 *  including: corrupting the body on the wire, aborting the associated
 *  Request, or sending a late status code for the Response.
