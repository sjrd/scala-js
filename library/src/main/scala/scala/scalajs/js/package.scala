/** Types, methods and values for interoperability with JavaScript libraries.
 *
 *  This package is only relevant to the Scala.js compiler, and should not be
 *  referenced by any project compiled to the JVM.
 *
 *  == Guide ==
 *
 *  General documentation on Scala.js is available at
 *  [[http://www.scala-js.org/doc/]].
 *
 *  == Overview ==
 *
 *  The trait [[js.Any]] is the root of the hierarchy of JavaScript types.
 *  This package defines important subtypes of [[js.Any]] that are defined
 *  in the standard library of ECMAScript 5.1 (or ES 6, with a label in the
 *  documentation), such as [[Object js.Object]], [[Array js.Array]] and
 *  [[RegExp js.RegExp]].
 *
 *  Implicit conversions to and from standard Scala types to their equivalent
 *  in JavaScript are provided. For example, from Scala functions to JavaScript
 *  functions and back.
 *
 *  The most important subtypes of [[js.Any]] declared in this package are:
 *  - [[Object js.Object]], the superclass of most (all) JavaScript classes
 *  - [[Array js.Array]]
 *  - [[Function js.Function]] (and subtraits with specific number of
 *    parameters)
 *  - [[ThisFunction js.ThisFunction]] and its subtraits for functions that
 *    take the JavaScript `this` as an explicit parameter
 *  - [[Dictionary js.Dictionary]], a [[scala.collection.Map Map]]-like view
 *    of the properties of a JS object
 *
 *  The trait [[js.Dynamic]] is a special subtrait of [[js.Any]]. It can
 *  represent any JavaScript value in a dynamically-typed way. It is possible
 *  to call any method and read and write any field of a value of type
 *  [[js.Dynamic]].
 *
 *  There are no explicit definitions for JavaScript primitive types, as one
 *  could expect, because the corresponding Scala types stand in their stead:
 *  - [[Boolean]] is the type of primitive JavaScript booleans
 *  - [[Double]] is the type of primitive JavaScript numbers
 *  - [[java.lang.String String]] is the type of primitive JavaScript strings (or `null`)
 *  - [[Unit]] is the type of the JavaScript undefined value
 *  - `Null` is the type of the JavaScript null value
 *
 *  [[UndefOr js.UndefOr]] gives a [[scala.Option]]-like interface where the
 *  JavaScript value `undefined` takes the role of `None`.
 *
 *  [[| A | B]] is an unboxed pseudo-union type, suitable to type values that
 *  admit several unrelated types in facade types.
 */
package object js {

  /** Value of type A or the JS undefined value.
   *
   *  This type is actually strictly equivalent to `A | Unit`, since `Unit` is
   *  the type of the `undefined` value.
   *
   *  `js.UndefOr[A]` is the type of a value that can be either `undefined` or
   *  an `A`. It provides an API similar to that of [[scala.Option]] through
   *  the [[UndefOrOps]] implicit class, where `undefined` take the role of
   *  [[None]].
   *
   *  By extension, this type is also suited to typing optional fields in
   *  native JS types, i.e., fields that may not exist on the object.

   *  Executes a block of code under a JavaScript `async` context.
   *
   *  The block of code can await [[Promise js.Promise]]s using [[await js.await]].
   *  Doing so will continue after the call to `js.await` when the given
   *  `Promise` is resolved. If the `Promise` is rejected, the exception gets
   *  rethrown at the call site.
   *
   *  A block such as `js.async { body }` is equivalent to an
   *  immediately-applied JavaScript `async` function:
   *
   *  {{{
   *  (async () => body)()

   *    val text: String = js.await(p)

   *
   *  This method returns a [[Promise js.Promise]] that will be resolved with
   *  the result of the code block. If the block throws an exception, the
   *  `Promise` will be rejected.
   *
   *  Calls to `js.await` can only appear within a `js.async` block. They must
   *  not be nested in any local method, class, by-name argument or closure.
   *  The latter includes `for` comprehensions. They may appear within
   *  conditional branches, `while` loops and `try/catch/finally` blocks.
