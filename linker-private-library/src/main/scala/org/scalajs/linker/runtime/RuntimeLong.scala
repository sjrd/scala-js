/* IMPORTANT NOTICE about this file
 *
 * The code of RuntimeLong is code-size- and performance critical. The methods
 * of this class are used for every single primitive operation on Longs, and
 * must therefore be as fast as they can.
 *
 * This means that this implementation is oriented for performance over
 * readability and idiomatic code.
 *
 * DRY is applied as much as possible but is bounded by the performance and
 * code size requirements. We use a lot of inline_xyz helpers meant to be used
 * when we already have the parameters on stack, but they are sometimes
 * duplicated in entry points to avoid the explicit extraction of heap fields
 * into temporary variables when they are used only once.
 *
 * Otherwise, we typically extract the lo and hi fields from the heap into
 * local variables once, whether explicitly in vals or implicitly when passed
 * as arguments to inlineable methods. This reduces heap/record accesses, and
 * allows both our optimizer and the JIT to know that we indeed always have the
 * same value (the JIT does not even know that fields are immutable, but even
 * our optimizer does not make use of that information).

     *   else
     *     new RuntimeLong(0, lo << n1)
     *
     * Replacing n1 by its definition, we have:
     *   if (n & 63 < 32)
     *     new RuntimeLong(lo << (n & 63),
     *         if ((n & 63) == 0) hi else (lo >>> 32-(n & 63)) | (hi << (n & 63)))
     *   else
     *     new RuntimeLong(0, lo << (n & 63))
     *
     * Since the values on the rhs of shifts are always in arithmetic mod 32,
     * we can get:
     *   if (n & 63 < 32)
     *     new RuntimeLong(lo << n, if ((n & 63) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n))
     *   else
     *     new RuntimeLong(0, lo << n)
     *
     * The condition `n & 63 < 32` is equivalent to
     *   (n & 63) & 32 == 0
     *   n & (63 & 32) == 0
     *   n & 32 == 0
     *
     * In the then part, we have `n & 32 == 0` hence `n & 63 == n & 31`:
     *   new RuntimeLong(lo << n, if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n))
     *
     * Consider the following portion:
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n)
     * When (n & 31) == 0, `hi == (hi << n)` and therefore we have
     *   (if ((n & 31) == 0) 0 else (lo >>> -n)) | (hi << n)
     *
     * The left part of the |
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) 0 else (lo >>> -n)
     * has the following branchless version:
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)
     * Indeed, when `n & 31 == 0, we have
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> 31 == 0
     * and when `n & 31 != 0`, we know that ((31-n) & 31) < 31, and hence we have
     *   lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n) == lo >>> (1+31-n) == lo >>> (32-n) == lo >>> -n
     *
     * Was it good? We have traded
     *   if ((n & 31) == 0) hi else (lo >>> -n) | (hi << n)
     * for
     *   (lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)) | (hi << n)
     * When (n & 31) != 0, which is the common case, we have traded a test
     * `if ((n & 31) == 0)` for one additional constant shift `>>> 1`. That's
     * probably worth it performance-wise. The code is also shorter.
     *
     * Summarizing, so far we have
     *   if (n & 32 == 0)
     *     new RuntimeLong(lo << n, (lo >>> 1 >>> (31-n)) | (hi << n))
     *   else
     *     new RuntimeLong(0, lo << n)
     *
     * If we distribute the condition in the lo and hi arguments of the
     * constructors, we get a version with only one RuntimeLong output, which
     * avoids reification as records by the optimizer, yielding shorter code.
     * It is potentially slightly less efficient, except when `n` is constant,
     * which is often the case anyway.
     *
     * Finally we have:

     * Since everything is interpreted as unsigned, all values are Natural
     * numbers and are >= 0, by construction.
     *
     * We are looking to compute
     * a *[64] b = (a * b) % 2^64
     *
     * We use the notation * and + for mathematical, non-overflowing
     * operations, and *[64] and +[64] for overflowing operations. Eventually,
     * we need to implement everything in terms of *[32] and +[32]. The symbol
     * ^ is used for exponentiation (not bitwise xor).
     *
     * The decomposition in 32-bit components yields:
     *
     * a *[64] b
     *   = ( (2^32*ahi + alo) * (2^32*bhi + blo) ) % 2^64
     *   = ( 2^64*ahi*bhi + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * With Natural numbers, congruence theory tells us that we can "distribute"
     * `% n` on + and *, as long as we also keep the outer `% n`. To be more
     * precise:
     *   (a + b) % n = (a%n + b) % n = (a + b%n) % n = (a%n + b%n) % n
     *   (a * b) % n = (a%n * b) % n = (a * b%n) % n = (a%n * b%n) % n
     *
     * From the latter, we derive a corollary that we'll implicitly use several
     * times later:
     *   (n * x) % n = 0  for any n > 0 and any x
     *
     * We can use these equivalences to get rid of parts of our computation:
     *
     * ( 2^64*ahi*bhi + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *   = ( (2^64*ahi*bhi % 2^64) + 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *        -------------------
     *             = 0
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * Observe that we can rewrite any quantity x as
     * x = n*(x/n) + x%n
     * where n is > 0 and / denotes the floor division.
     *
     * We can rewrite the product ahi*blo as
     *
     * ahi*blo
     *   = 2^32*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + (ahi*blo % 2^32)
     *   = 2^32*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + (ahi *[32] blo)
     *
     * Similarly,
     *
     * bhi*alo = 2^32*(alo*bhi / 2^32) + (alo *[32] bhi)
     *
     * Taking back our complete computation:
     *
     * a *[64] b
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi*blo + bhi*alo) + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *   = ( 2^64*(ahi*blo / 2^32) + 2^32*(ahi *[32] blo)
     *        + 2^64*(alo*bhi / 2^32) + 2^32*(alo *[32] bhi)
     *        + alo*blo ) % 2^64
     *
     * where distributing % 2^64 allows to get rid of the most awful parts:
     *
     *   = ( 2^32*(ahi *[32] blo) + 2^32*(alo *[32] bhi) + alo*blo) % 2^64
     *
     * Now we focus on the `alo*blo` part. We decompose it in 16-bit components.
     *
     * alo * blo
     *   = 2^32*a1*b1 + 2^16*a1*b0 + 2^16*a0*b1 + a0*b0
     *
     * Because a1, a0, b1 and b0 are all <= 2^16-1, their pair-wise products
     * are all <= (2^16-1)^2 = 2^32 - 2*2^16 + 1 = 0xfffe0001 < 2^32. This
     * means that, for example,
     *   a1*b0 = (a1*b0) % 2^32 = a1 *[32] b0
     * with the same applying to other subproducts.
     *
     * Let
     *   a1b1 = a1 *[32] b1

     * alo * blo
     *   = 2^32*a1b1 + 2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0
     *
     * We can decompose it using / and % as follows:

     *
     * Let

     *
     * Then

     *
     * aloblo = (alo * blo) % 2^32
     *   = (2^32*a1b1 + 2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0) % 2^32
     *   = (2^16*a1b0 + 2^16*a0b1 + a0b0) % 2^32

     *

     * is therefore a valid double. It must also be non-zero, since
     * (lo, hi) >= 2^53 > 10^9.
     *
     * We should do that single division as a Long division. However, that is
     * slow. We can cheat with a Double division instead.
     *
     * We convert the unsigned value num = (lo, hi) to a Double value
     * approxNum. This is an approximation. It can lose as many as
     * 64 - 53 = 11 low-order bits. Hence |approxNum - num| <= 2^12.
     *
     * We then compute an approximated quotient
     *   approxQuot = floor(approxNum / 10^9)
     * instead of the theoretical value
     *   quot = floor(num / 10^9)
     *

     * Therefore, |approxQuot - quot| <= 1.
     *
     * We also have 0 <= approxQuot < 2^53, which means that approxQuot is an
     * "unsigned safe double" and that `approxQuot.toLong` is lossless.
     *
     * At this point, we compute the approximated remainder
     *   approxRem = num - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong
     * as if with Long arithmetics.
     *
     * Since the theoretical remainder rem = num - 10^9 * quot is such that
     * 0 <= rem < 10^9, and since |approxQuot - quot| <= 1, we have that
     *   -10^9 <= approxRem < 2 * 10^9
     *
     * Interestingly, that range entirely fits within a signed int32.
     * That means approxRem = approxRem.toInt, and therefore
     *
     *   approxRem
     *     = (num - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong).toInt
     *     = num.toInt - 10^9 * approxQuot.toLong.toInt (thanks to modular arithmetics)
     *     = lo - 10^9 * unsignedSafeDoubleLo(approxQuot)
     *
     * That allows to compute approxRem with Int arithmetics without loss of
     * precision.
     *
     * We can use approxRem to detect and correct the error on approxQuot.
     * If approxRem < 0, correct approxQuot by -1 and approxRem by +10^9.
     * If approxRem >= 10^9, correct them by +1 and -10^9, respectively.
     *
     * After the correction, we know that approxQuot and approxRem are equal
     * to their theoretical counterparts quot and rem. We have successfully
     * computed the correct quotient and remainder without using any Long
     * division.
     *
     * We can finally convert both to strings using the native string
     * conversions, and concatenate the results to produce our final result.

     * `x.toDouble` is lossless, then the result of `x.toFloat` is equivalent
     * to `x.toDouble.toFloat`.
     *
     * However, as illustrated in #4466, it is not equivalent when the Long
     * value is very close though not equal to a Float midpoint. Indeed, in
     * that case the conversion to Double can be rounded to the Float midpoint,
     * destroying the information of whether the Long value was above or below
     * the midpoint. When converting the Double into Float, this causes
     * rounding to "even" where a round up or down would have been necessary.
     *
     * To avoid that, we first "compress" the input Long `x` into another Long
     * `y` such that:
     * - `y.toDouble` is lossless, and
     * - `y.toFloat == x.toFloat`.
     *
     * The algorithm works as follows:
     *
     * If the input is a signed safe Double, then the conversion to double is
     * lossless, so we don't have to do anything special (`y == x` in terms of
     * the above explanation).
     *
     * Otherwise, let us first assume that `x >= 0`. In that case, we know that
     * the input's highest 1 bit is in the 11 highest-order bits. That means
     * that rounding to float, which only has 24 bits in the significand, can
     * only take into account the `11 + 23 + 1 = 35` highest-order bits (the
     * `+ 1` is for the rounding bit). The remaining bits can only affect the
     * result by two states: either they are all 0's, or there is at least one
     * 1. We use that property to "compress" the 16 low-order bits into a
     * single 0 or 1 bit representing those two states. The compressed Long
     * value `y = (compressedLo, hi)` has at most `32 + 17 = 49` significant
     * bits. Therefore its conversion to Double is lossless.
     *
     * Now that we always have a lossless compression to Double, we can perform
     * it, followed by a conversion from Double to Float, which will apply the
     * appropriate rounding.
     *
     * (A similar strategy is used in `parseFloat` for the hexadecimal format,
     * where we only have the non-negative case.)
     *
     * For the case `x < 0`, logically we should negate it, perform the above
     * transformation and convert to Double, then negate the result. It turns
     * out we do not need a separate code path. Indeed, if x is a safe double,
     * then -x also converts losslessly (-x may not be safe double by our
     * definition, because it could be exactly 2^53, but the conversion is
     * still exact). Otherwise, we should apply a compression if
     * `(-x & 0xffffL) != 0L`. Because of how two's complement negation work,
     * that is equivalent to `(x & 0xffffL) != 0L`, and therefore also
     * equivalent to `(lo & 0xffff) != 0`. When we do need a compression, we
     * can do it on the signed representation just as well as the unsigned
     * representation, because it only affects `lo`, and `lo` is interpreted as
     * unsigned regardless, when converting to a double.

    /* The algorithm here is inspired by Hacker's Delight formula for `abs`.
     * However, a naive application of that formula does not give good code for
     * our RuntimeLong implementation.
     *
     * Let a be the input value RTLong(lo, hi). Overall, we want to compute:
     *   val longSign = a >> 63
     *   (a ^ longSign) + (if (longSign) 1L else 0L)
     * The last addition is performed as `- longSign` in the original formula.
     * For our purpose, it is more convenient to take a step back and express
     * it as the if expression.
     *
     * First, observe that `longSign.lo` and `longSign.hi` are both equal to
     * `hi >> 31`. We therefore define
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     * and rewrite our second expression by expanding the long xor:
     *   RTLong(lo ^ sign, hi ^ sign) + (if (sign) 1L else 0L)
     *
     * Making the lo/hi words of the result of the xor explicit, we get:
     *
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   RTLong(xlo, xhi) + (if (sign) 1L else 0L)
     *
     * At this point, it is convenient to examine what happens when we expand
     * the addition, assuming that the 1L branch is taken. We expand
     * `RTLong(xlo, xhi) + RTLong(1, 0)` and get:
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo + 1
     *   val rhi = xhi + 0 + (((xlo & 1) | ((xlo | 1) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *   val rhi = xhi + (((xlo & 1) | ((xlo | 1) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *
     * Since only the most significant bit of the complicated logic expression
     * is relevant, we can rewrite the 1's as 0's so that `& 0` and `| 0` fold
     * away:
     *
     *   val rhi = xhi + (((xlo & 0) | ((xlo | 0) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + (((      0) | ((xlo    ) & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((       0  | ( xlo      & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((            ( xlo      & ~rlo)) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *
     * If the 0L branch was taken, then we should instead have
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo + 0 = xlo
     *   val rhi = xhi + 0 = xhi
     *
     * Let us put back together everything we have so far:
     *
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   val rlo = xlo + (if (sign) 1 else 0)
     *   val rhi = xhi + (if (sign) ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31) else 0)
     *
     * We can remove the branch for rlo as
     *
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign
     *
     * Now let's just imagine we always took the then branch for rhi. We would
     * overall get:
     *
     *   val sign = hi >> 31
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign
     *   val rhi = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *
     * That's correct when `sign = -1`. But what happens when `sign = 0`? Let
     * us work it out:
     *
     *   val sign = 0
     *   val xlo = lo ^ sign = lo
     *   val xhi = hi ^ sign = hi
     *   val rlo = xlo - sign = xlo = lo
     *   val rhi = xhi + ((xlo & ~rlo) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + (( lo & ~lo) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + ((    0    ) >>> 31)
     *           = xhi + 0
     *
     * Bingo! It works as well! So we can take the code of the "let's just
     * imagine" step. We inline the rhs of xhi at the only place where it is
     * used, and we get the final algorithm.
